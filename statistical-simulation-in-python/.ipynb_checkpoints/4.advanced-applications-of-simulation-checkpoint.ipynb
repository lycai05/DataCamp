Rain is normally distributed with mean 50 and standard deviation 15. For now, let's fix cost at 5,000. Corn produced in any season is a Poisson random variable while the average corn production is governed by the equation:\n",

Suppose that price is normally distributed with mean 40 and standard deviation 10. You are given a function corn_demanded(), which takes the price and determines the demand for corn. This is reasonable because demand is usually determined by the market and is not in your control.\n",
