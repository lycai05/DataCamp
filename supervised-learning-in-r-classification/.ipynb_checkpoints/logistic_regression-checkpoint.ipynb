    "#### Building simple logistic regression models\n",
    "The donors dataset contains 93,462 examples of people mailed in a fundraising solicitation for paralyzed military veterans. The donated column is 1 if the person made a donation in response to the mailing and 0 otherwise. This binary outcome will be the dependent variable for the logistic regression model.\n",

    "When building a regression model, it is often helpful to form a hypothesis about which independent variables will be predictive of the dependent variable. The bad_address column, which is set to 1 for an invalid mailing address and 0 otherwise, seems like it might reduce the chances of a donation. Similarly, one might suspect that religious interest (interest_religion) and interest in veterans affairs (interest_veterans) would be associated with greater charitable giving.\n",

    "In the previous exercise, you used the glm() function to build a logistic regression model of donor behavior. As with many of R's machine learning methods, you can apply the predict() function to the model object to forecast future behavior. By default, predict() outputs predictions in terms of log odds unless type = \"response\" is specified. This converts the log odds to probabilities.\n",

    "Because a logistic regression model estimates the probability of the outcome, it is up to you to determine the threshold at which the probability implies action. One must balance the extremes of being too cautious versus being too aggressive. For example, if you were to solicit only the people with a 99% or greater donation probability, you may miss out on many people with lower estimated probabilities that still choose to donate. This balance is particularly important to consider for severely imbalanced outcomes, such as in this dataset where donations are relatively rare.\n",
