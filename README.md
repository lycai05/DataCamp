## Courses taken at [DataCamp](datacamp.com)
- In DataCamp, courses are organized into small pieces of videos and coding exercies.
- It focuses more on implementations of different methods using R or Python, and less on mathematics behind them, so it is a good place for learning pratical data science.
- Courses labelled "reproducible" means I did some extra work to download the originial datasets or to manipulate the code. The notebook can now run locally, thus suitable for self-learning.
