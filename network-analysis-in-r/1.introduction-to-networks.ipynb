Depending upon the size of a given network different layouts may be more effective in communicating the structure of the network. Ideally the best layout is the one that minimizes the number of edges that cross each other in the network. In this exercise you will explore just a few of the many default layout algorithms. Re-executing the code for each plot will lead to a slightly different version of the same layout type. Doing this a few times can help to find the best looking visualization for your network."
